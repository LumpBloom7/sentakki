sentakki is a recreation of maimaiDX for use within osu, taking advantage of the longevity and the osu ecosystem for features such as multiplayer, beatmap listing, and leaderboards.

## Status


All the essential note types have been implemented. Features like editor is being developed on the side, since lazer doesn't support third party ruleset editors yet. PP/diff calc haven't been given considered yet, and it is currently open to ideas.

## Demo

## Trying the ruleset

Prebuilt binaries are provided for users who doesn't want to create a development environment. Releases are guaranteed to work with the latest version of lazer at the time of release.

## Debugging and Developing

Some prerequisites are required before attempting to debug or develop:

* A desktop platform with the .NET 8 SDK or higher installed.
* An IDE with support for C#, providing auto completion and syntax highlighting. I recommend using Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio Code.
* Other requirements are shared with osu!lazer and osu!framework

### Downloading the source code

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lumpbloom7/sentakki
cd sentakki
```

To update the source code to the latest commit, run the following command inside the osu directory:

```sh
git pull
```

### Building

Using the `Build` command from your IDE should generate a DLL file within the output directory. If you're debugging or developing, it is a bit more convenient to run the `VisualTests` project instead since that'll remove the need to copy the dll to your lazer directory.

You can also build sentakki from the command-line with a single command:

```sh
dotnet build osu.Game.Rulesets.Sentakki
```
